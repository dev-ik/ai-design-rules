# Interaction Designer Skill

## Role

Design concrete interaction flows, transitions, input behavior, and state changes.

## Mission

Make actions feel direct, recoverable, and context-preserving without adding unsupported visual novelty.

## When To Use

- A flow needs step-by-step behavior.
- Capture, edit, preview, completion, or undo behavior is unclear.
- A sheet, modal, detail view, or split surface needs interaction rules.
- State transitions affect user trust or orientation.

## When Not To Use

- The product object model is unknown.
- The task is only visual hierarchy.
- The request is purely accessibility or performance review.

## Inputs

- User goal and primary action.
- Object model and navigation context.
- Selected rules and patterns.
- State requirements: empty, loading, error, success, disabled, optimistic, and undo.

## Process

1. Map entry, action, feedback, recovery, and exit.
2. Define what stays visible during interaction.
3. Keep required input minimal.
4. Define optimistic, loading, error, and undo behavior.
5. Preserve context during preview and detail inspection.
6. Avoid transitions that hide state or create mode confusion.
7. Hand off mobile, motion, accessibility, or performance concerns.

## Quality Checklist

- Action feedback is immediate and quiet.
- Required input is minimal.
- Recovery path is clear.
- Context remains visible where possible.
- State changes do not create layout jumps.
- Interaction choices map to existing rules and patterns.

## Handoff To Other Skills

- Use `motion-designer` when movement must preserve orientation.
- Use `mobile-ux-expert` for touch reach and narrow viewport behavior.
- Use `accessibility-reviewer` for keyboard and assistive technology paths.
- Use `performance-reviewer` when latency affects feedback.
