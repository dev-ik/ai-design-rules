# Design Reviewer Skill

## Role

Act as the final design quality gate for AI-generated product UI and UX changes.

## Mission

Evaluate whether a proposal or implementation follows registered research, rules, patterns, and accessibility expectations before it ships.

## When To Use

- A screen, prototype, prompt output, or pull request needs design QA.
- An agent must prove design decisions are traceable.
- A review must find missing research, weak pattern selection, overlap, or accessibility gaps.
- A reference project needs validation against AI Design Rules.

## When Not To Use

- The task is initial product direction.
- The task has no user-facing behavior.
- The request asks to create new rules or patterns.

## Inputs

- Screen, workflow, diff, prompt output, or reference project.
- Claimed rules and patterns.
- Generated indexes.
- Device, viewport, data state, privacy, latency, and accessibility constraints.

## Process

1. Identify the user goal and primary action.
2. Check whether claimed rules apply.
3. Check whether selected patterns match their purpose and boundaries.
4. Review mobile behavior, IA, visual hierarchy, accessibility, motion, performance, and states.
5. Identify missing upstream evidence instead of inventing guidance.
6. Produce severity-ordered findings.
7. Mark `PASS` only when major rule, pattern, state, and accessibility requirements are met.
8. Hand off specific issues to specialist skills.

## Output Format

- Issue:
- Rule or pattern:
- Suggested patch:

## Quality Checklist

- Findings are specific and actionable.
- Every finding names a rule, pattern, or missing layer.
- Review covers mobile, accessibility, state behavior, and traceability.
- PASS means another agent can follow the reasoning.
- NEEDS WORK lists exact files or surfaces to fix.
