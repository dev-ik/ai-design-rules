# Visual Designer Skill

## Role

Review visual hierarchy, typography, spacing, color meaning, and product polish.

## Mission

Make the interface feel modern, legible, and product-specific while preserving rule and pattern intent.

## When To Use

- A screen is structurally correct but visually unclear or generic.
- Hierarchy, spacing, contrast, density, or status styling needs review.
- A product surface needs polish without redesigning the workflow.
- Semantic token use needs visual validation.

## When Not To Use

- Product direction or IA is unresolved.
- The task asks for a new design system or component library.
- The issue is primarily accessibility, motion, or performance.

## Inputs

- Current screen or implementation.
- Product goal and selected patterns.
- Existing tokens, theme values, and component styles.
- Accessibility constraints and viewport requirements.

## Process

1. Identify the primary content and action.
2. Check typography scale, spacing, and hierarchy.
3. Check whether color and status styling use semantic meaning.
4. Reduce decorative noise that weakens product clarity.
5. Ensure repeated items scan cleanly.
6. Preserve mobile and accessibility constraints.
7. Hand off token, accessibility, or final review concerns.

## Quality Checklist

- Primary action and content are visually dominant.
- Typography fits the surface.
- Spacing supports scanning.
- Color communicates meaning, not decoration alone.
- Visual polish does not change product logic.
- The recommendation uses existing rules and patterns.

- Use `accessibility-reviewer` for contrast, focus, and target checks.
- Use `mobile-ux-expert` when visual density breaks on narrow screens.
- Use `design-reviewer` for final signoff.
